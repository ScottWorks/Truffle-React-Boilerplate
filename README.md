## Installation

Before getting started this guide assumes the following are installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 5.0 or later
- Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X

This project was developed using the [Truffle Framework](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview), it offers alot of features that are very useful for developing Decentralized Applications on the Ethereum Network. Shout out to [Adrian Li](https://github.com/adrianmcli/truffle-react) for making a great fork.

1. If you have not already done so install truffle globally `npm install -g truffle`

2. Next you should fork and clone the repo, once the repo is cloned issue the following command at the root of the directory `npm install`. In the Command-Line navigate to the client `cd ./client/` and enter `npm install` again.

3. When the all the packages have been installed we will launch a local version of the Ethereum blockchain that our smart contracts will intereact with. Navigate back to the root of the directory and enter the following `truffle develop`.

4. At this point we need to compile the smart contracts then migrate them by entering `compile` inside the Truffle Development Console followed by `migrate`. After the migration is succesful copy the ./contracts folder into the ./src directory. NOTE: Remember to copy the contracts folder after every migration.

5. Now that our local development blockchain is live we can connect MetaMask. If you have not done so already install [MetaMask](https://www.metamask.io), then create an account. Once that has been completed login and change the network from Main Etherenum Network to Custom RPC, this should allow you to enter a "New RPC URL", in this field put "http://127.0.0.1:9545". This RPC URL should match that of the development blockchain. Last import some of the private keys found in the Truffle Development Console into MetaMask.

6. Finally, open a new instance of the CLI (should be at the directory root), then navigate to the client folder `cd ./client/`. At this point we are ready to launch the webpack server and begin interacting with the Meme Bounty Client, enter `npm start` and have fun!

## Testing

1. Running the tests that are included in the test folder is a straightforward process. First make sure that you have completed steps 1 - 3 in the 'Installation' section.

2. In the Truffle Development console enter `test`, this should initiate a series of 10 tests that were written in JavaScript.
